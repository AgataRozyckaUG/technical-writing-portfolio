# 📝 Cloning and Running a Node.js To-Do App

This guide explains how to clone a simple To-Do application built with Node.js and MongoDB, install its dependencies, and run it locally.

---

## 🔍 Prerequisites
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed
- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) installed and running locally
- Access to a terminal (Command Prompt, Bash, PowerShell)

## 🔧 Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/scotch-io/node-todo.git
cd node-todo
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start MongoDB
Make sure your MongoDB server is running locally:
```bash
mongod
```
*(or use MongoDB Atlas if you prefer a cloud database)*

### 4. Run the Application
```bash
node server.js
```

---

## 📊 Verifying the Application
- Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/`.
- You should see a simple To-Do list web application.

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

- **MongoDB connection error:**
  Ensure MongoDB is installed and running on your local machine.

- **Port conflict:**
  Make sure no other application is using port `8080`.
